This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tech Stack

1. Front-end: ReactJS
2. Framework: NextJS
3. Mock API: NextJS API route

## Features covered

1. Responsive design (Mobile to 4K)
2. Redux Toolkit RTK query for fetching the data. Implemented to fetch the list of users for quick transfer functionality
3. Fetch API for fetching the data of bank cards and transaction history
4. Error Boundary for error handling in components
5. Lazy loading implemented for Chart components using Next.js dynamic route to fetch the components lazy to improve the performance of the page.
6. Used Tailwind CSS for styling
7. NextJS is used instead of Create React App to create the mock API.
8. NextJS in-built routing mechanism is used instead of React Router.
9. Chart.JS for building the charts.
10. Memoize the components to avoid re-renders

## Pending Tasks

1. Buttons, Search and Profile are not added. Considered as out of scope.
2. Lazy loading for API data.
3. Creation and Integration of all the API.
